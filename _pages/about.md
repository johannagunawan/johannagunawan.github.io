Hi -- I'm an Assistant Professor of CS and Law at the [Maastricht University Law and Tech Lab](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/law/research/law-and-tech-lab). 

My research spans UX, privacy, consumer protections, and law. At present, I'm focusing on [dark patterns](https://www.deceptive.design) and manipulative interfaces across multiple contexts -- I also study surveillance technologies and privacy erosion. 

Before joining Maastricht University, I earned my PhD in Cybersecurity at Northeastern University, advised by [David Choffnes](https:/david.choffnes.com), [Woodrow Hartzog](https://woodrowhartzog.com), and [Christo Wilson](https://cbw.sh). In industry, I've interned at [Common Sense Media's Privacy Program](https://privacy.commonsense.org/), Vimeo's Governance, Risk, Compliance, and Privacy team, and previously wrote docs for Rapid7 and Akamai Technologies (Network Standards). 
Academically, I've been a visiting PhD intern with [Yixin Zou](https://yixinzou.github.io/) at the [Max Planck Institute of Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/), and earned my M.S. in Cybersecurity as an [ALIGN Scholar](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/align-masters-of-science-in-computer-science/) as well as a B.A. in Political Science & International Affairs at Northeastern University.

(If you're wondering how to pronounce my name, I've gone by both American and European pronunciations of Johanna my whole life--both work!)
