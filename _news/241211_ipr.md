Delighted to share that our (Colin Gray, Cristiana Santos, and Nataliia Bielova) work titled __Leveraging Interdisciplinary Methods for Evidence Collection in Enforcement: Dark Patterns as a Case Study__ has been accepted for a special issue in the *Internet Policy Review* on "The Craft of Interdisciplinary Research and Methods in Public Interest Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Digital Rights Governance." We're working on revising the work--stay tuned for a preprint.
