I presented our work on [comparative work on dark patterns in modalities](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479521) at [CSCW'21](https://cscw.acm.org/2021/) (despite some virtual conference technical difficulties), following attendance at an [awesome workshop on privacy, design, and IoT](https://pearl.umd.edu/cscw2021-workshop/) the day before.
