Our ([Cristiana Santos](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/CTeixeiraSantos), [Irene Kamara](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/i-kamara), and myself) paper on dark patterns harms and opportunities for redress was accepted to the [2nd ACM Symposium on Computer Science and Law](https://computersciencelaw.org/2022)! More news soon -- looking forward to presenting our case study and learnings in Washington, D.C. this November.
