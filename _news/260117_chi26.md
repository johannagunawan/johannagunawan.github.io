Our (Sanju Ahuja, myself, Cristiana Santos, and Nataliia Bielova) paper titled ``Dark Patterns and the EU Digital Services Act: Mapping Autonomy Violations and Design Factors'' has been conditionally accepted to CHI'26. Looking forward to co-presenting in Barcelona, and co-facilitating a [workshop on bridging commercial norms and ethical design practice to combat dark patterns](https://chi2026.darkpatternsresearchandimpact.com/). Workshop registration ends Feb 12, do come join us!
