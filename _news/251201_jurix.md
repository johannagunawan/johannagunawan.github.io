Thrilled to announce that our (Lyra Hoeben-Kuil, Gijs van Dijck, Jaromir Savelka, myself, Konrad Kollnig, Marta Kolacz, Shashank Chakravarthy, and Hannes Westermann) work titled __Can LLMs Create Legally Relevant Summaries and Analyses of Videos?__ was accepted to the [JURIX'25](https://jurix2025.di.unito.it/home) International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems! We'll be presenting on this fantastic work in Torino just next week.
