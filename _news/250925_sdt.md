Many thanks to the Dutch Digital Supervisors' Cooperation Platform (SDT) for having me as a breakout session panelist for this year's Symposium. Our panel was ["Making online choices as a consumer: are you being tempted or misled?"](https://www.sdt-symposium.nl/programma-onderdelen/sessie/284aeaae/)
