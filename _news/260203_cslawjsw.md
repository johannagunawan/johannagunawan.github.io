My co-chair and I are thrilled to invite ACM CSLAW'26 attendees (and others) to this year's __Junior Scholars' Workshop__! This half-day workshop the morning of the first day of the main Symposium is intended for early-career scholars in CS+law (students, postdocs, assistant professors, etc) to build community, provide advice in navigating interdisciplinary careers, and foster discussion about research in this interdiscipline. Do join us!
