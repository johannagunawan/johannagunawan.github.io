Thank you to fantastic moderators Gorana and Minhee for having me in the dark patterns panel at [PrivacyCon](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events/2022/11/privacycon-2022), and to the great folks organizing the second [ACM CSLaw](https://computersciencelaw.org/2022/program/). It was lovely to learn from so many talks spanning multiple topics and to present our work as well. Up next: workshopping a paper in a lightning session at the Northeast Privacy Scholars Workshop 11/11.
