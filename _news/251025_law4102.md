We've kicked off our new [Master's Specialisation in Law and AI](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/programmes/european-law-school-law-ai) with LAW4102: Introduction to Modern Computing and AI. I'm thrilled to be teaching this course to law masters' students and sharing all the fun stuff computer science has to offer over the next 7 weeks. We're learning to build computational thinking skills, some programming experience, and familiarity with technical concepts.
