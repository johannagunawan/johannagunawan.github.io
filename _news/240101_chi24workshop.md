Calling all dark patterns (and adjacent) scholars: join our CHI'24 workshop, [Mobilizing Research and Regulatory Action on Dark Patterns and Deceptive Design Practices](https://chi2024.darkpatternsresearchandimpact.com/)! The CFP for short position papers and general attendance statements is open, with submissions due February 14, 2024 AoE. The workshop will be delivered in hybrid format, with in-person attendees in Honolulu for the main CHI conference.
