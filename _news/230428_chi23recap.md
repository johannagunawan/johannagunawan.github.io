What a wonderful, first in-person CHI I had! It was great to meet and have such amazing conversations with the HCI research community. In the dark patterns space, many awesome papers were presented, and we held a fruitful SIG and Panel. Thank you to all who came to the events; to keep the conversations going, come [join the DPs research community on Slack](darkpatternsresearch.slack.com)!
