Many thanks to the wonderful students and faculty at Indiana University's Maurer School of Law for the wonderful centennial symposium for the Indiana Law Review! I had a wonderful time presenting our (w/ Woodrow Hartzog, Neil Richards, David Choffnes, and Christo Wilson) work framing dark patterns as disloyal design. 

On to updating the draft, forthcoming spring 2025.
