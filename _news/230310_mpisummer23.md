Now that all the travel documents are squared away, I'm thrilled to share that I'll be working with [Yixin Zou](https://yixinzou.github.io/) as a research intern this summer in the new Human-Centered Security and Privacy group at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)](https://www.mpi-sp.org/). Looking forward to experiencing the EU's data subject rights first-hand and working with wonderful people in Europe. Please send me life in Germany tips and recomemndations!
